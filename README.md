## Requirements

- Python (ms-python.python) addon installed

    - the extension only support [Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), other library for BDD test is not guaranteed.
    - you may install [Cucumber (Gherkin) Full Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete) first. It's a powerful and compatible extension.
